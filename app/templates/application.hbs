1. Please take the design in the attached file and implement it using modern html and css. 
2. Integrate the html and css into the ember app by customizing the template in templates/application.hbs
3. Make a get request to "/activities" in routes/application.js when the application loads and send that data to your template 
4. Load the data from your request into the card components inside your template. You may  choose to simply include the HTML markup in a loop or use a component. That's your call!
5. (Bonus Item, time permitting) Make the activity items responsive such that it looks great on mobile as well as desktop. Use your judgement as we will not provide a mobile mockup.
